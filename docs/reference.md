## Skills

Claude Code skills in DoFlow use three invocation modes:

- **Manual command**: invoked by typing `/skill-name`; used for side effects, commits, implementation execution, and explicit workflow control.
- **Hybrid**: invoked directly or auto-loaded by Claude when the request clearly matches; auto mode is read-only unless the user explicitly asks for edits.
- **Auto-loaded policy**: hidden from the slash menu and loaded by Claude as background guidance.

### Invocation Modes

| Mode | Skills | Contract |
|------|--------|----------|
| Manual command | `do`, `do-brainstorm`, `do-build`, `do-cleanup`, `do-constitution`, `do-design`, `do-execute-plan`, `do-git`, `do-help`, `do-implement`, `do-improve`, `do-index`, `do-load`, `do-pm`, `do-plan`, `do-reflect`, `do-save`, `do-spawn`, `do-spec`, `do-spec-panel`, `do-task`, `do-tasks`, `do-test` | Human chooses timing with `/skill-name` (`disable-model-invocation: true`). Use for side-effectful workflows, implementation, cleanup, commits, build actions, planning, and explicit orchestration. |
| Hybrid read-only | `do-analyze`, `do-document`, `do-estimate`, `do-explain`, `do-flow`, `do-review`, `do-select-tool`, `do-troubleshoot`, `parallel-agents` | Claude may auto-load for matching requests (`disable-model-invocation: false`). Auto mode analyzes, drafts, verifies, recommends, or coordinates only. File edits require explicit user request and `confidence-check` first; `do-flow` additionally stops at its own approval gates before implementation or commit. |
| Auto-loaded policy | `confidence-check`, `code-conventions`, `java-conventions`, `token-efficiency` | Background guidance only (`user-invocable: false`). Users normally do not invoke these directly. |
| Forked research | `do-research` | Runs isolated research (`context: fork`, `agent: deep-research-agent`) when invoked or selected for a matching research task. |

### Doflow Chain (spec-driven delivery)

`do-constitution` → `do-spec` → `do-plan` → `do-tasks` → `do-execute-plan` → `do-review` form the normal feature delivery path (merged into core; no longer a separate opt-in extension). `do-flow` auto-chains all six phases in sequence, pausing only at its three approval gates (unresolved spec clarifications, before implementation, before commit/merge):

```bash
# Create the feature spec (WHAT/WHY) — seeds spec.md in a branch-coupled feature dir
/do-spec "feature description" --slug 003-example

# Generate the implementation plan (HOW) from spec.md, with a Constitution Check gate
/do-plan --strategy systematic

# Generate a dependency-ordered tasks.md from plan.md
/do-tasks --parallel

# Execute tasks.md via pm-agent orchestration, gated by the implement-phase prerequisite hook
/do-execute-plan --next --safe

# Review the resulting diff against spec.md/tasks.md before commit or merge
/do-review --scope changed --format mr

# Or auto-chain the whole flow end to end
/do-flow "feature description"
```

`do-execute-plan` is gated by `pre-implement-gate.sh`, which blocks source edits until `plan.md` and `tasks.md` exist. `do-review` is review-only by default and reports code-quality findings plus spec/task traceability (coverage of `FR-###`/`US#` items) before summaries.

Hybrid read-only skills such as `do-analyze`, `do-document`, `do-estimate`, `do-explain`, `do-review`, `do-select-tool`, and `do-troubleshoot` can be invoked directly or auto-loaded by Claude when the request clearly matches. In auto mode, they analyze, draft, verify, or recommend only; implementation edits require an explicit user request and the `confidence-check` gate first.

`parallel-agents` coordinates from the main context. It may dispatch isolated agents only after proving the tasks are independent, have no sequential dependency, and do not share write scope.

`confidence-check` is mandatory before implementation-class work:

- Creating or editing source files
- Refactoring existing code
- Fixing bugs through code or test changes
- Adding, removing, or upgrading dependencies
- Changing runtime configuration or architecture
- Executing generated implementation workflows

It should not block pure explanation, read-only review, estimation, brainstorming, or requirements discovery.

### PM Orchestration

`do-pm` is the project manager layer for broad or multi-step requests. It can coordinate discovery, planning, implementation, validation, review, and session notes from a single prompt:

```bash
/do-pm "
Goal: modernize the dashboard filters.
Scope: UI controls, query-state handling, tests, and browser verification.
Validation: run frontend tests and verify the dashboard in Playwright.
Deliverable: working implementation, validation output, review notes, and follow-up actions.
" --strategy wave --verbose
```

Strategy guide:

| Strategy | Use When |
|----------|----------|
| `brainstorm` | The goal is vague and requirements need discovery before implementation |
| `direct` | The task is clear and small enough for a focused pass |
| `wave` | The task spans multiple phases, domains, or validation gates |

`do-pm` routes plan-execution requests to `/do-execute-plan` and review requests to `/do-review`. Use `/do-task` instead when you already have one bounded task with a clear start and stop.

## Agents

| Agent | Specialization |
|-------|---------------|
| `backend-architect` | Backend systems, APIs, data integrity |
| `code-reviewer` | Merge request, diff, branch, and coding standard review |
| `deep-research-agent` | Comprehensive multi-source research |
| `devops-architect` | Infrastructure, CI/CD, reliability |
| `frontend-architect` | UI/UX, accessibility, frontend performance |
| `performance-engineer` | Bottleneck identification and optimization |
| `pm-agent` | PDCA self-improvement workflow execution |
| `python-expert` | Python best practices and modern patterns |
| `quality-engineer` | Testing strategy and systematic edge case detection |
| `refactoring-expert` | Code quality improvement and technical debt |
| `requirements-analyst` | Requirements discovery and specification |

## Hooks

| Hook | Event | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| `session-start.sh` | `SessionStart` | Captures git branch, SHA, last 5 commits to `sessions/{id}/git-context.json` |
| `user-prompt-submit.sh` | `UserPromptSubmit` | Injects git context on first prompt only via `additionalContext` |
| `pre-bash-guard.sh` | `PreToolUse(Bash)` | Blocks dangerous patterns; reads `blocked-patterns.conf` |
| `post-edit-lint.sh` | `PostToolUse(Edit\|Write)` | Collects edited file paths to `edited-files.txt` |
| `stop-check.sh` | `Stop` | Batch lint dispatch; blocks if last assistant response has TODO/stub |
| `pre-compact.sh` | `PreCompact` | Outputs git state as `custom_instructions` for the compaction LLM |
| `post-compact.sh` | `PostCompact` | Saves AI-generated compact summary to `projects/{cwd_hash}/last-compact-summary.md` |
| `session-end.sh` | `SessionEnd` | Logs END, writes uncommitted-warning, deletes session dir, trims log |

**Blocked operations** (always denied, no override):
```
git push --force        (git push --force-with-lease is allowed)
git reset --hard
git clean -fd
rm -rf /  rm -rf ~/  rm -rf $HOME
DROP TABLE / DROP DATABASE / DROP SCHEMA
DELETE FROM <table> ;   (no WHERE clause)
TRUNCATE TABLE
curl <url> | bash  /  wget <url> | bash
```

**State directories** (in `~/.config/doflow/session-env/`):
```
sessions/{session_id}/     — private per Claude Code window
  git-context.json         — branch, sha, commits, uncommitted count
  injected                 — flag: additionalContext already sent this session
  edited-files.txt         — paths collected by post-edit-lint.sh

projects/{cwd_hash}/       — shared per project directory, across all agents
  last-compact-summary.md  — AI-generated summary from last /compact
  uncommitted-warning.txt  — written if session ended with dirty tree
  meta.json                — last_agent, last_active, compacted_at, branch
```

Override base path: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/custom/path` (defaults to `~/.config`).
Override agent identity: `DOFLOW_AGENT=codex` (defaults to `claude-code`).

## Rules

Four rule files loaded into every session via `CLAUDE.md`:

**RULE_01_SAFETY — Critical** (never compromise)
- Root cause analysis always — understand WHY before fixing
- Never skip or disable tests to pass builds
- `git status && git branch` before starting; feature branches for all work
- Force-push to main is never allowed

**RULE_02_WORKFLOW — Important**
- Parallel by default — batch independent operations; never read-one-by-one then edit-one-by-one
- Start it = Finish it — no TODO stubs, no "not implemented" throws
- Validate before execution, verify after; run lint/typecheck before marking complete
- Build ONLY what's asked — no bonus features, no enterprise bloat

**RULE_03_QUALITY — Recommended**
- Follow language naming standards (camelCase JS, snake_case Python)
- No marketing language — no "blazingly fast", no invented metrics
- Push back on bad approaches; evidence-based claims only
- Tests in `tests/`, scripts in `scripts/`, reports in `agent-docs/`

**RULE_04_QUESTIONS — Important**
- Ask only for genuine user-owned decisions; when you have enough to act, act
- Clarifications use structured multiple-choice (Claude Code: `AskUserQuestion`; Codex/Gemini: question file)
- 2–4 meaningful mutually-exclusive options + mandatory "Other"; no filler options
- Validate answers for contradictions/ambiguity before proceeding

**Conflict resolution priority:** Safety > Scope > Quality > Speed
